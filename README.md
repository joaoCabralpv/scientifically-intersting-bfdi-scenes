# scientifically-intersting-bfdi-scenes
A list of scenes that are important for BFDI Science.

Each file has the episode and time of some scene in BFDI that I tought would be consider.

Each file corresponds to a certain area, for better organization.

Some files are also devided into multiple sections, especialy the `Biology` file, wich has a section for every character and some other animals and plants

The `3D` and `Things coming out of thin air` files are not updated for the most recent episodes because I don't think adding more information would be very usefull.
