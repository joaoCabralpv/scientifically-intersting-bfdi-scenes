BFDI 4 4:33-4:38 Eraser’s mouth and eye is on the side but goes to the front
BFDI 4 5:22-5:28 I don’t think the rate at which the cylinder is being filed up makes scene. And when Needle opens the other bag, the cylinder gets less full.

BFDI 8 8:17(And all the orher times we see Ice Cube Break in this scene) The shards don't seem to have the same volume as Ice Cube
BFDI 8 8:32-8:39 (Maybe not cannon)

BFDI 10 4:40 Blocky goes trough the glass
BFDI 10 4:56 Pencil goes trough the floor (The snow they are standing on could be lower that the snow we see in the video)
BFDI 10 4:56 Pencil makes a perfect snowball in less than 1 frame
BFDI 10 5:33-5:38
