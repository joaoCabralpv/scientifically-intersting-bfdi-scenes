 
BFDI 1a 3:34 Woody walks on air(maybe not canon)

BFDI 3 6:17-6:17 Needle is low quality

BFDI 4 4:33-4:38 Eraser’s mouth and eye is on the side but goes to the front
BFDI 4 5:22-5:28 I don’t think the rate at which the cylinder is being filed up makes scene. And when Needle opens the other bag, the cylinder gets less full.

BFDI 6 8:53-8:55 The raft grew
BFDI 8 3:36-3:38 The wheel changes
BFDI 8 3:56 GB image changes on the wheel
BFDI 8 5:42
BFDI 8 8:17(And all the orher times we see Ice Cube Break in this scene) The shards don't seem to have the same volume as Ice Cube
BFDI 8 8:32-8:39 (Maybe not cannon)

BFDI 10 4:40 Blocky goes trough the glass
BFDI 10 4:56 Pencil goes trough the floor (The snow they are standing on could be lower that the snow we see in the video)
BFDI 10 4:56 Pencil makes a perfect snowball in less than 1 frame
BFDI 10 5:33-5:38
BFDI 11 1:10-1:10 Each character appears multiple times (this also happens in other episodes)

Also, I don't think the area of sand we see here is preserved between frames afters the sand starts falling. The sand also doesn't move at 4:04 and 4:16 and 4:20
BFDI 14 3:47 Flower and the bread she is holding get squished horizontaly

BFDI 21 7:06-7:09
BFDI 21 7:10-7:12 Bubble turns into metal, this may because of the yoylecake she ate before but the yoyleberries trun people into metal after right after they get eaten so it coulde becouse of something else
